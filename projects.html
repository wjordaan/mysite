                <p>Data mining and analysis of dozens of wells to optimize survey points and minimize NPT.
                         Analysis of data was done to determine time for each function performed while drilling, including off-bottom activities.
                         Focus of project was around the impact of survey times, optimizing procedures and tool selection to minimize non-productive time (NPT).
                         A comparative study of competitors was conducted, to identify areas of improvement along with areas of strength.</p>

                    <p>Study showed significant opportunity to reduce operator NPT, with icremental approach taken to apply lessons learned to optimize wellsite performance.
                         Lessons learned included leveraging experience from other geomarkets, specifically US Land, to introduce alternative drilling solutions.
                         Final results of study allowed the operator to reduce NPT by up to 18 hours per well.</p>

                <p>Program automating client final deliverable generation and quality control, reducing time to process logs by over 50%.
                     Internal procedures require cross-referencing of engineering reports, final logs, and regulatory documentation to ensure accurate final deliverables.
                     In place systems also required field representatives to edit post well deliverables before sumbmission to internal quality control.</p>

                <p>Project was to automate all cross referencing and post job processing, replacing previous manual methods.
                     Required documents for quality control are imported using a one-click solution, with a detailed report of deficiencies created to log all implemented changes.
                     With prompts confirming edits prior to generating final deliverable, ensuring maximum flexibility for the end user.
                     All final deliverables are generated as per client formatting requirements, with regulatory naming conventions automatically applied based on geographic location.</p>

                    <p>Optimal wellbore placement is crucial in maximizing the ultimate recovery from the reservoir. Traditional techniques follow a well plan based on predetermined geological models. Project examined heterogeneity of Viking formation, specifically with finding a “sweet spot” for wellbore placement to maximize ultimate recovery from reservoir. To achieve this reservoir navigation (RNS) was utilized. As traditional gamma ray has a very limited depth of investigation, deep azimuthal resistivity was required.</p>
                    <p>Working closely with clients, multiple fields were analyzed and compared to offset traditional wellbores in the area. Leveraging the deep azimuthal resistivity technology for reservoir navigation showed very positive results for improved wellbore placement. Resulting in increased production, with very minor increases in authority of expenditure (AFE).</p>
