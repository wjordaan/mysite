                <p>As an avid hiker, there is nothing more I enjoy than spending a day (or three) out in the beautiful outdoors. While I enjoy all types of hiking, my perfect day would be scrambling up a mountain, and it goes without saying a cup of coffee (or cold beer) with lunch at the top is essential. </p>
                <p>No summer is complete without joining a rec sports league. As such my summer evenings are filled with either soft ball or ultimate frisbee. Kicking back with a beer on the sidelines, perfecting that farmers tan.</p>
                <p>Really though, I am up for anything that gets you out and about. Whether that is a game of hockey or a relaxing float down the bow, you can count me in.</p>
                
                <h3 style="text-align: center">Volunteering</h3>
                <p>Giving back to the community, especcially those less fortunate is immensely important. With so many in need around the city to do so, it is not difficult to make an impact. From the Drop-In-Center, Mustard Seed, or simply giving to the food drive, every little bit helps.</p>
                <img class="project-pic-med" src="images/volunteer.png" width="33%" style="float:right"/>                     
                <p>I have been fortunate enough to be involved with Junior Achivement since 2015. Delivering classroom presentations to a wide age range on topics from basic budgeting to explaining the inner working of investments. Along with being involved with the company program, where students start their own company and over the course of 16 weeks, develop and market a product.</p>
                <p>Through my network of teachers, I frequently do classroom presentations on various subjects from geology to bridges. While far from an expert on most of the topics, I enjoy sharing my passion of science and engineering with students. Hopefully that passion will encourage the next generation to consider a STEM career when their time comes.</p>
