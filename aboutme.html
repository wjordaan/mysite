                <p>As an avid hiker, there is nothing more relaxing than spending a day (or three) out in the beautiful outdoors. While you cant go wrong with any type of hiking, scrambling up a mountain presents the perfect mix of reward to challenge. It goes without saying a cup of coffee (or cold beer) with lunch at the peak is essential.</p>
                <p>Sport is far from my forte, but no reason to give up without a fight. Ultimate frisbee, soft ball, curling, golf, take your pick. Enjoy all of them and then some, just donâ€™t expect an impressive show of talent. Although a good laugh is guaranteed watching the attempt, maybe with a side of an hilarious wipeout.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center">Volunteering</h3>
                <p>Giving back to the community, especially those less fortunate is immensely important. With so many in need, there are countless opportunities to give back and make an impact. From the Drop-In-Center, Mustard Seed, or simply giving to the food drive, every little bit helps.</p>
                <p>Fortunate enough to be involved with Junior Achievement since 2015, I have the opportunity to pass along both life and practical knowledge. Delivering classroom presentations to a wide range of students on topics from basic budgeting to explaining the inner working of investments. Along with being involved with the company program, where over the course of 16 weeks, students develop and market a product. Learning with first hand experience the challenges and rewards of entrepreneurship.</p>
                <p>Outside of formal volunteering, I frequently do classroom presentations on various subjects from geology to bridges as guest a guest speaker. While far from an expert on most of the topics, I enjoy sharing my passion of science and engineering with students. Encouraging the next generation to consider the sciences as a future career path.</p>
